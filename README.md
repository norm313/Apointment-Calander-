# Apointment-Calander-
A text based calander system 

I am a 1947 modle am almost blind 
and a programer with 25+ years working 
on an AS/400 platform from the fist one 
and the last one was a server modle. 
I managed to work for a tech college and 
enjoyed the design part very much the cod4ing 
part not so much, testing was interesting (never learned to spell) 
and rewrites not at all. 

I am building a application to manage my appointments. A totally text based system. 

Just for me by Me.
